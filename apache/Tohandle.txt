keep alive && chuncked. requires epoll ?
what is the role of keep alive : if the client may want other ressources
he sends it in the header.

// test keep 
// send image : will require chunked, keep alive.

// --> need epoll. 100%.

// "Remember that images are binary files, so the server mustn't treat them as text."

// chunked benefits : The client (like a browser or media player) starts playback without needing to wait for the entire stream.
    // easier on the server side.
    // 
// video fail : does the client send more than one request to get the video ? // allow multiplexing. yep
// to do : fix multiplexing.
// ater connecting where does the client write ? server socket or his socket.

// :: for each new connection set socket options.

    struct epoll_event ev;
    ev.data.fd = new_fd;
    ev.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLHUP | EPOLLERR;

    after the response has been sent you delete the connection ---> keep the response body., 
    // in the response should have values of : progress, totalbytes, sent, clientfd. when to close a connection ?.


// check the new request class.
