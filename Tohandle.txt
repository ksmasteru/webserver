keep alive && chuncked. requires epoll ?
what is the role of keep alive : if the client may want other ressources
he sends it in the header.

// test keep 
// send image : will require chunked, keep alive.

// --> need epoll. 100%.

// "Remember that images are binary files, so the server mustn't treat them as text."

// chunked benefits : The client (like a browser or media player) starts playback without needing to wait for the entire stream.
    // easier on the server side.
    // 
// video fail : does the client send more than one request to get the video ? // allow multiplexing. yep
// to do : fix multiplexing.
// ater connecting where does the client write ? server socket or his socket.

// :: for each new connection set socket options.

    struct epoll_event ev;
    ev.data.fd = new_fd;
    ev.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLHUP | EPOLLERR;

    after the response has been sent you delete the connection ---> keep the response body., 
    // in the response should have values of : progress, totalbytes, sent, clientfd. when to close a connection ?.


// check the new request class.
!!
A server that receives a request message with a
 transfer coding it does not understand SHOULD respond with 501 (Not Implemented).

 If a valid Content-Length header field is present without Transfer-Encoding, 
 its decimal value defines the expected message body length in octets. 
 If the sender closes the connection or the recipient
  times out before the indicated number of octets are received,
   the recipient MUST consider the message to be incomplete and close the connection.

   a keepalive tiemout (5s by default) and a connection timeout 2min

   // if a client send a request after he has been removed it causes a SIGPIP.
   // client timeout + send again a request error:
   // add a functions that checks wheter the fd is closed ?
// if it is closed and you receive a read event it should be added
// as a new client and given a new fd.

// sending the wrong page asked causes the browser to close the connection.
// to avoid sigpip check readines to write  ?
// easy solution send the whole 404page in one send. // Fixedd !


// !!!handle client closing connection mid transfer : HARD

//  if (evlist[i].events & EPOLLHUP || evlist[i].events & EPOLLERR)



!!!!!!!!!!!! each server can have multiple sockets, currenct implentation only hanles one
socket per server.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!overflow of content length causes the connection to close // yes :: try with chunked


FIXED: browser send multi request for fetching video ? : a way to block this connection!.
// range
bytes=0- block requests with this header. or can you check if the socket was blocked ?
and simply close the connection. !!!!!!!!!!!!! DONE

ISSUE : handle all throw calls.


TODO : use config file.
in config file make sure that each location ends with / ! ?

!!!!!!!!!!IN POST A USER SEND IN THE header cont-len 11 ut only send 5 == server hangs. why wasnt it timeout ? : detect where it hangs.

!!! adjust timer for each phase :: handled.

should requestFile struct be reset during a reset.
